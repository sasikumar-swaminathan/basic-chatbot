# Getting started
1. First download a text editor of your liking. I personally use Sublime Text. Which you can download at https://www.sublimetext.com/.

2. Download this repository for the basic folder structure and materials such as images. 

3. Start with the basic html structure. You can find an html template at https://www.w3schools.com/html/. 

4. Link the right font family by copying the following tag in the head tag:
  `<link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Roboto:300,400" rel="stylesheet">`
  
5. Include your custom styling css by adding the following tag in the head: `<link rel="stylesheet" href="./css/style.css">`
  
6. Double click on the index.html in order to open the webpage with your favourite browser (although ideally you use Google Chrome).

7. You can use ResponsiveVoiceJs to implement the voice functionality on your page. The API details of responsive voice can be found at https://responsivevoice.org/api/
